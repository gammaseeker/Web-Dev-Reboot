		DESIGN
		Using clever HTML placement and CSS, we can create a display that is intuitive and useful for a player.
		
		CSS 1
		Create a background image by using an <img /> element.  The size is not terribly important as it will be resized on loading.
		
		CSS 2
		Break the elements up into sections, using row and column display style.
		
		The "maincontainer" helps gain control over the other elements on the page.
		
		There are 2 columns, defined by <span> tags.  The first holds the letters.  I put them into a table to make it easier to equalize their display.  Below them are the rest of the controls including the textbox, the guess button, and the reset button.  The second column holds the gallows and the puzzle.
		
		<br /> and <hr /> tags can be used to separate elements in the columns.
		
		CSS 3
		Create a title.  Put the title into an h1, so that we have block element centering ability.  Put the text of the title into a span so that we have the ability to style just that span.
		
		CSS 4
		Add a background image to the maincontainer and to the title span, giving them a more solid background on which to show the game information.
		
		CSS 5
		Style the table so that each letter button has the same width.  I put 4 buttons in each row, leaving 2 for the end. Unfortunately, 26 letters doesn't make for a good block grid.
		
		CSS 6
		Everything else has to do with design choices.  Set up the fonts and sizes according to your tastes.
